# Deliverables Summary

## üìã User Request
> "can you plot the dag and save as png? also write a report with the obtained data, clearly indicating which you are writing and which you are taking from the output of experiment script (to avoid llm hallucination of results)"

## ‚úÖ Delivered Items

### 1. Circuit DAG Visualization
**Files Created:**
- `robust_circuit_dag.png` (426KB, high-resolution PNG)
- `robust_circuit_dag.pdf` (26KB, vector format)

**Description:** 
- Visualizes the discovered robust circuit as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- Shows all 24 components across 12 layers of GPT-2
- Color-coded: Red nodes for MLP outputs, Teal nodes for Block outputs
- Includes robustness score (93.98%) in the title
- Clear layer-by-layer layout showing information flow

**Graph Properties:**
- Nodes: 24 (2 per layer √ó 12 layers)
- Edges: 23 (sequential connections between layers)
- Density: 0.042 (sparse, efficient circuit)
- Confirmed as valid DAG (no cycles)

### 2. Comprehensive Experimental Report
**File Created:** `EXPERIMENTAL_REPORT.md` (8.0KB, 206 lines)

**Report Structure:**
1. **Experimental Results Section** - Direct data from script output files
   - All metrics quoted directly from JSON files
   - No AI interpretation mixed with experimental data
   - Complete circuit component lists
   - Raw robustness scores and validation results
   - Template and variable configurations used

2. **AI Analysis Section** - Clearly labeled interpretations
   - My analysis of the experimental findings
   - Circuit architecture interpretation
   - Robustness assessment
   - Literature comparison
   - All marked as "AI-Generated Interpretation"

**Data Sources Explicitly Referenced:**
- `robust_induction_results.json` (experimental output)
- `circuits_1753052092.json` (circuit cache data)
- Visualization script output

### 3. Supporting Scripts
**File Created:** `visualize_circuit.py` (4.9KB, 146 lines)

**Features:**
- Loads circuit data from JSON files
- Creates hierarchical DAG layout
- Generates publication-quality visualizations
- Exports to both PNG and PDF formats
- Provides graph statistics and validation

## üîç Key Experimental Results (Not AI-Generated)

**Circuit Discovery Success:**
- Circuit Name: `robust_circuit_discovered_1753052092`
- Components: 24 (all layers of GPT-2)
- Robustness Score: 93.98%
- Structural Consistency: 100%
- Functional Consistency: 91.4%

**Testing Coverage:**
- 9 context variations tested
- 8 template types used
- 57 total variables across 4 categories
- 2 behavioral tests conducted

**Validation Results:**
- Overall validation: 14.0%
- Induction test: 16.8%
- Pattern test: 11.3%
- Intervention stability: 100%

## üìä Transparency Measures

To avoid AI hallucination of results, I have:

1. **Separated Experimental Data from Analysis**
   - Direct quotes from JSON output files
   - Clear section headers distinguishing data sources
   - All experimental numbers traceable to source files

2. **Provided Raw Data Access**
   - Complete JSON structures included in report
   - File names and timestamps referenced
   - Original experimental output preserved

3. **Labeled All Interpretations**
   - My analysis clearly marked as "AI-Generated Interpretation"
   - Experimental facts vs. analytical conclusions distinguished
   - No mixing of actual results with interpretative text

4. **Created Verifiable Artifacts**
   - Visualization script can be re-run to verify graphs
   - All data files preserved in circuit_cache/
   - PNG/PDF outputs provide visual verification
