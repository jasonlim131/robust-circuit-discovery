# <img src="https://i.ibb.co/N1kYZy5/icon.png" width="30" height="30"> **Customizable Interventions on Internals of Different Neural Architectures**
To interpret causal mechanisms of neural networks with their internals, we introduce **align-transformers**, an open-source and intervention-oriented Python library that supports customizable interventions on different families of neural architectures (e.g., RNN or Transformers). The basic operation is an in-place activation modification during the computation flow of a neural model. It supports complex intervention schemas (e.g., parallel or serialized interventions) and a wide range of intervention modes (e.g., static or trained interventions) to enable practitioners to quantify counterfactual behaviors at scale to gain interpretability insights. We showcase **align-transformers** out-of-box supports a wide range of intervention-based interpretability methods such as causal abstraction, circuit finding, and knowledge localization. **align-transformers** provides a unified and extensible framework to perform interventions on neural models, and to share interventions with others.


## Interventions v.s. Alignments with Model Internals
In this section, we discuss topics from interventions to alignments with model internals.

### Interventions
Intervention is the basic unit of this library. It means manipulating the model's activations, without any assumption of how the model behavior will change. We can zero-out a set of neurons, or swap activations between examples (i.e., interchange interventions). Here, we show how we can intervene in model internals with this library.

#### Loading models from HuggingFace
```py
from models.utils import create_gpt2

config, tokenizer, gpt = create_gpt2()
```

#### Create a simple intervenable config
```py
intervenable_config = IntervenableConfig(
    intervenable_model_type="gpt2",
    intervenable_representations=[
        IntervenableRepresentationConfig(
            0,            # intervening layer 0
            "mlp_output", # intervening mlp output
            "pos",        # intervening based on positional indices of tokens
            1             # maximally intervening one token
        ),
    ],
)
```

#### Turn the model into an intervenable object
The basic idea is to consider the intervenable model as a regular HuggingFace model, except that it supports an intervenable forward function.
```py
intervenable_gpt = IntervenableModel(intervenable_config, gpt)
```

#### Intervene by swapping activations between examples
```py
base = tokenizer("The capital of Spain is", return_tensors="pt")
sources = [tokenizer("The capital of Italy is", return_tensors="pt")]

_, counterfactual_outputs = intervenable_gpt(
    base,
    sources,
    {"sources->base": ([[[4]]], [[[4]]])} # intervene base with sources
)
```

### Alignments
If the model responds systematically to your interventions, then you start to associate certain regions in the network with a high-level concept. This is an alignment. Here is a more concrete example,
```py
def add_three_numbers(a, b, c):
    var_x = a + b
    return var_x + c
```
The function solves a 3-digit sum problem. Let's say, we trained a neural network to solve this problem perfectly. **One concrete alignment problem is** "Can we find the representation of (a + b) in the neural network?". We can use this library to answer this question. Specifically, we can do the following,

- **Step 1:** Form Alignment Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a set of neurons N aligns with (a + b).
- **Step 2:** Counterfactual Testings: If our hypothesis is correct, then swapping neurons N between examples would give us expected counterfactual behaviors. For instance, the values of N for (1+2)+3, when swapping with N for (2+3)+4, the output should be (2+3)+3 or (1+2)+4 depending on the direction of the swap.
- **Step 3:** Reject Sampling of Hypothesis: Running tests multiple times and aggregating statistics in terms of counterfactual behavior matching. Proposing a new hypothesis based on the results. 

To translate the above steps into API calls with the library, it will be a single call,
```py
intervenable.evaluate_alignment(
    train_dataloader=test_dataloader,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    inputs_collator=inputs_collator
)
```
where you provide testing data (basically interventional data and the counterfactual behavior you are looking for) along with your metrics functions. The library will try to evaluate the alignment with the intervention you specified in the config. You can follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/frankaging/align-transformers/blob/main/tutorials/Generic%20alignment%20training.ipynb) for alignment finding and evaluation with a provided fine-tuned gpt2 model.

### Alignments with Trainable Interventions
The alignment searching process outlined above can be tedious when your neural network is large. For a single hypothesized alignment, you basically need to set up different intervention configs targeting different layers and positions to verify your hypothesis. Instead of doing this brute-force search process, you can turn it into an optimization problem which also has other benefits such as distributed alignments. For details, you can read more here[^ii].

In its crux, we basically want to train an intervention to have our desired counterfactual behaviors in mind. And if we can indeed train such interventions, we claim that causally informative information should live in the intervening representations! Below, we show one type of trainable intervention `models.interventions.RotatedSpaceIntervention` as,
```py
class RotatedSpaceIntervention(TrainableIntervention):
    
    """Intervention in the rotated space."""
    def forward(self, base, source):
        rotated_base = self.rotate_layer(base)
        rotated_source = self.rotate_layer(source)
        # interchange
        rotated_base[:self.interchange_dim] = rotated_source[:self.interchange_dim]
        # inverse base
        output = torch.matmul(rotated_base, self.rotate_layer.weight.T)
        return output
```
Instead of activation swapping in the original representation space, we first **rotate** them, and then do the swap followed by un-rotating the intervened representation. Additionally, we try to use SGD to **learn a rotation** that lets us produce expected counterfactual behavior. If we can find such rotation, we claim there is an alignment. `If the cost is between X and Y.ipynb` tutorial covers this with an advanced version of distributed alignment search, [Boundless DAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08809). There are [recent works](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RFtkRXHebkwxygDe2/an-interpretability-illusion-for-activation-patching-of) outlining potential limitations of doing a distributed alignment search as well.

You can now also make a single API call to train your intervention,
```py
intervenable.train(
    train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
    compute_loss=compute_loss,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    inputs_collator=inputs_collator
)
```
where you need to pass in a trainable dataset, and your customized loss and metrics function. The trainable interventions can later be saved on to your disk. You can also use `intervenable.evaluate()` your interventions in terms of customized objectives.

## Unit-tests
When adding new methods or APIs, unit tests are now enforced. To run existing tests, you can kick off the python unittest command in the discovery mode as,
```bash
cd align-transformers
python -m unittest discover -p '*TestCase.py'
```
When checking in new code, please also consider to add new tests in the same PR. Please include test results in the PR to make sure all the existing test cases are passing. Please see the `qa_runbook.ipynb` notebook about a set of conventions about how to add test cases. The code coverage for this repository is currently `low`, and we are adding more automated tests.
